## Previously Launched Spacecraft
The performance of previously launched spacecraft with high delta velocities
(&Delta;v) are tabulated in _Table 1_.
The total &Delta;v's are from the zero velocity reference point
at launch. The totals include the booster phases plus the on-board spacecraft
propulsion.
The spacecraft &Delta;v's are the results of the post-booster(s) separation, 
spacecraft only propulsion systems.
The Dawn spacecraft &Delta;v far exceeded all of the other spacecraft listed.
The ion drive, albeit low thrust, provides continuous propulsion throughout
Dawn's trip. This is contrast with chemical rockets which provide relatively
high thrust in short bursts.
The spacecraft dry mass is listed as opposed to its launch mass since the 
proposed Plasma Magnetic Drive (PMD) is propellantless.
Whether the PMD is comparable in mass to a spacecraft's more traditional
ion/chemical drive is a core question that remains to be answered.
Gravity assists are used in orbital trajectories to exchange momentum between
a close encounter of a solar system body and the spacecraft.
Hence free &Delta;v is gained. For the spacecraft listed, Venus, earth-moon,
Mars, and Jupiter were used for gravity assists.
